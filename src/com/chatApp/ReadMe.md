#ChatApp

##Introduction

This is a simple chat app written in java.

##Usage

To run the program, open the terminal and cd into whatever location the repository is in and simply compile all files. Run Server.java and Client.java in seperate terminals (javac Server.java/Client.java -> java Server/Client)

Run the server first and then run the client.

##Beware

When entering your name or sending a message, the Enter key doesn't work. You have to press the appropriate button on the UI. When you want to disconnect from the server, you can press either the disconnect button or simply close the window.
